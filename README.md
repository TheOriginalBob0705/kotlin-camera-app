# Simple Camera App
**Disclaimer**: DO NOT use this application to take pictures of sensitive, important, secretive, or proprietary materials, or any materials of a similar nature. This application was created for educational purposes as part of a cybersecurity course on mobile malware and pentesting. It is not intended for real-world use and contains intentional vulnerabilities for learning purposes. Any pictures taken using this app while the device is connected to the Internet get uploaded automatically to an external endpoint that belongs to me. Thus, be sure to use this application responsibly and only in controlled environments.
