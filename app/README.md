# Camera App - Kotlin Compose

This is a project I created to learn about the CameraX library and Jetpack Compose, as well as a bit of SQLite and Navigation. It is a simple app that allows you to take a picture and save it to your device, as well as upload it to a remote location.
Also includes a simple registration and login screen.

## Libraries Used
- Compose: A modern toolkit for building native Android UI. Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
- CameraX: A Jetpack support library, built to help make camera app development easier. It provides a consistent and easy-to-use API surface that works across most Android devices, with backward-compatibility.
- Coil: An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- Navigation: Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within the app. 
- Room: The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
